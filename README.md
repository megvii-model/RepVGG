# RepVGG: Making VGG-style ConvNets Great Again

The PyTorch implementation and pretrained models are available at 
https://github.com/DingXiaoH/RepVGG

The MegEngine version will be released in several days.

This is a super simple ConvNet architecture that achieves over 80% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a stack of 3x3 conv and ReLU! This repo contains the pretrained models, code for building the model, training, and the conversion from training-time model to inference-time.

# Abstract

We present a simple but powerful architecture of convolutional neural network, which has a VGG-like inference-time body composed of nothing but a stack of 3x3 convolution and ReLU, while the training-time model has a multi-branch topology. Such decoupling of the training-time and inference-time architecture is realized by a structural re-parameterization technique so that the model is named RepVGG. On ImageNet, RepVGG reaches over 80\% top-1 accuracy, which is the first time for a plain model, to the best of our knowledge. On NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU, RepVGG models run 83% faster than ResNet-50 or 101% faster than ResNet-101 with higher accuracy and show favorable accuracy-speed trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art models like EfficientNet and RegNet.
